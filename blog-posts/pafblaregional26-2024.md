### PA FBLA RLC Region 26 Conference at Shippensburg University, PA


I had so much fun at this conference!! We went with the Shippensburg Area Senior High School FBLA Chapter. 
I got to meet so many great professionals, connections, and fellow students. I presented my FBLA Business Ethics project 
and did my Regional Officer Campagib Speech in front of the whole conference. Even though I did not get the position, 
it was an excellent experience for public speaking. During the event, I did a takeover at @nshss to document the event for their 34K followers. 
Thank you Region 26 FBLA officers and advisers, our FBLA chapter, and Shippensburg University for hosting the event!!
