I would like to announce that I've been accepted into the Keystone State Challenge Academy for a 22-week program running from January 2024 to June 2024.

My decision to attend this academy stems from my desire to enhance my leadership skills and prioritize my mental well-being by fostering discipline. 
Please understand that during this time, I won't be reachable, but each of you will be in my thoughts.

Though this journey will take me away from home, I'm fully committed to overcoming challenges. 
Your unwavering support has been invaluable, and I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunities this experience will offer me.

While this journey might keep me away from home, I am steadfast in my commitment to overcoming challenges.

I eagerly await the day I return and the promising future ahead. Thank you for standing by me in the past, and I eagerly look forward to reconnecting when I return.

KSCA Admissions:

We would like to Congratulate all of you. Owen has been accepted for our January class!!! I have attached a copy of his acceptance letter as well as the packing list.

We will be in touch as to the specific time for him to come on Sunday, January 14th.

 

Again, Congratulations on your acceptance into our program. Not everyone who applies is invited to participate in our program, only those whom we feel will be most successful.

 

Have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you all in January."

I struggle with Autism, Anxiety, Depression, Self-harm, add, and others. The traditional school environment is not challenging
enough for me, and socially it has become not of my liking. I would like to challenge myself to become a better person, 
not to repeat the same fallacy; create a new definition. I hope to enroll in a business school and become an
entrepreneur. To achieve that, become the head of a company, I need to challenge myself to become a better
person. At the Keystone State Challenge Academy, I hope to unleash my better side and have it last the test of
time. This experience will help me accomplish my educational and career goals, by teaching me the discipline and life
lessons necessary to achieve them.



 I struggle with mental health and self-harm, so even though I may not be struggling in school, I need a challenge to ensure self-discipline and 
 motivation as well as ethical practices in my everyday life. I envision myself emerging from the academy as a better well-rounded person committed to the ideals 
 of success without my other side, which ruins things and opportunities impulsively. I look forward to the possibility of an opportunity to attend your academy.
